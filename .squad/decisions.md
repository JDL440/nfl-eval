# Squad Decisions

## Active Decisions

### 2026-03-12: User directive — Model override
**By:** Joe Robinson (via Copilot)
**What:** All agents should use claude-opus-4.6 model. No exceptions.
**Why:** User request — premium tier for maximum quality on NFL domain analysis.

### 2026-03-12: User directive — Role-based agent names
**By:** Joe Robinson (via Copilot)
**What:** Rename specialist agents from Ocean's Eleven cast names to role-based names: Danny→Lead, Rusty→Cap, Livingston→Injury, Linus→Draft, Basher→Offense, Turk→Defense, Virgil→SpecialTeams. Easier to remember.
**Why:** User request — role-based names are more intuitive for an NFL domain team.

### 2026-03-12: User directive — 1M context fallback
**By:** Joe Robinson (via Copilot)
**What:** If agents hit context window limits or compaction, switch them to claude-opus-4.6-1m (1M context) model.
**Why:** User request — agents doing heavy research may need larger context windows to avoid data loss.

### 2026-03-12: NFC West 2026 Cap Landscape — Strategic Findings
**By:** Cap (Salary Cap Specialist)
**Status:** Proposed
**Affects:** ARI, LAR, SF, SEA team agents; Draft agent; Trade agent

**What:**
1. **SF faces a cap crisis** — $16.1M effective space, $36.2M dead money, projected $13.7M OVER the 2027 cap. Worst multi-year position in the NFC West. Purdy's $24.4M cap hit is SF's one structural advantage.
2. **SEA has cap ammo but lost key starters** — Cleanest cap in NFL ($483K dead money), $40.5M space. Lost Mafe, Walker III, Bryant in free agency. Can make 2-3 more signings or trade up in draft.
3. **ARI is best positioned for sustained competitiveness** — $41.7M raw space (7th in NFL), healthy 2027 outlook (~$17.2M projected). Buying window.
4. **LAR is cap-constrained with aging core** — $20.5M space (17th), 63% of cap on offense. Stafford ($48.3M) and Adams ($28M at 34) create aging-core risk. Only ~$3.2M projected for 2027.
5. **Edge rusher market diverged** — Elite tier now $40M+ AAV. Bosa's $34M AAV aging well relative to market. SEA's Nwosu at $9.76M is below market.

**Why:** Based on OTC and Spotrac data, cross-verified with ✅ confidence tags. 2027 projections from OTC multi-year models.

### 2026-03-12: 2026 NFL Draft Class — NFC West Implications
**By:** Draft (Draft Expert Specialist)
**Status:** Proposed
**Affects:** ARI, LAR, SF, SEA team agents

**What:**
1. **ARI holds pick #3** — Elite EDGE available (Bain Jr., Bailey). Full 7-round capital.
2. **LAR at #13** (acquired from ATL) — Access to top WR, OT, or CB talent.
3. **SF at #27** — Missing R3 pick (sent to DAL). Late first-round BPA approach likely.
4. **SEA at #32** — Mostly intact capital through R1-R3. Classic BPA spot.
5. **Defense-heavy class** — EDGE, LB, S, CB dominate top 15. Only consensus R1 QB is Mendoza (#1 to LV).
6. **Combine risers:** Sadiq (TE, Oregon), Styles (LB, Ohio State), Iheanachor (OT, Arizona State).

**Why:** Draft is April 23–25, 2026. Team agents need prospect-to-need mapping at their respective draft positions.

### 2026-03-12: Data Source Strategy for Web Research
**By:** Lead (Team Lead Specialist)
**Status:** Proposed
**Affects:** All 32 team agents, all 7 specialists

**What:**
- **Primary sources:** OTC for salary cap, Spotrac for free agents/contracts, ESPN for rosters/depth/transactions, NFL.com for UFA/RFA/ERFA tags.
- **Blocked:** Pro Football Reference returns 403 on all URLs — do NOT attempt PFR fetches.
- **Constraints:** OTC free agency page is JS-rendered (use Spotrac). OTC player IDs can't be guessed. Use `max_length=10000+` for cap/roster pages.

**Why:** Probed 15+ URLs across 5 data sources on 2026-03-12. PFR blocks automated access. Documented in `.squad/skills/`.

### 2026-03-13: User directive — Verify FA availability before recommending
**By:** Joe Robinson (via Copilot)
**What:** When trades/signings are reported by multiple outlets, consider them high confidence (🟢 Likely). Agents should check availability before recommending FA targets — don't suggest players who are already signed or traded.
**Why:** User request — avoid recommending unavailable players. Accuracy over speculation.

### 2026-03-13: FA Availability Alert — Seahawks targets revised
**By:** Media (NFL Media & Rumors Specialist)
**Status:** Proposed
**Priority:** HIGH
**Affects:** SEA team agent, Lead, all specialists who contributed to Seahawks FA analysis

**What:**
Of 20 players recommended in Seahawks FA analysis, 7 are confirmed unavailable (signed or traded). Key removals: Hendrickson (BAL), Koonce (LV re-sign), Awuzie (BAL), T. Johnson (traded LV), Kohou (KC), R. White (WSH), Deebo Samuel (contract voided — now UFA again). Still available: Bosa, Clowney, Von Miller, Calais Campbell, Lattimore, Douglas, Hobbs, Tre'Davious White, Najee Harris, Bobby Wagner, D.J. Reader, Jauan Jennings. EDGE, CB, and RB groups need revision.
**Why:** FA market moves fast. Several recommendations were outdated within hours of publication. All future target boards must verify current availability.

### 2026-03-13: Washington State Millionaires Tax changes Seattle's tax advantage
**By:** PlayerRep (Player Advocate & CBA Expert)
**Status:** Proposed
**Priority:** HIGH
**Affects:** SEA team agent, Cap, Lead, all specialists who referenced Seattle's "zero income tax" advantage

**What:**
WA passed SB 6346 on 2026-03-12 — 9.9% income tax on all personal income over $1M/yr, effective 2028-01-01. Applies to W-2 salary and visiting-athlete jock tax. Constitutional challenge likely (40–60% chance struck down). For 2026–2027, Seattle retains zero-tax advantage. For 2028+, a $20M/yr SEA contract loses ~$1.88M/yr to state tax — dropping the "$20M in SEA = $23M in SF" narrative to approximately "$20M in SEA ≈ $20.8M in SF." Short-term deals unaffected; multi-year deals need front-loading. Rookie contracts under $1M/yr unaffected regardless.
**Why:** Fundamentally changes Seattle's FA recruiting pitch for contracts extending past 2027. All prior analyses claiming zero-tax advantage need asterisks. TX/FL/TN/NV teams now have unambiguous tax edge over SEA.
